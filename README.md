# Tips for Staying Warm

Ol' Zachy-boy has seen his fair share of cold weather, so you can trust he knows what he's talking about when it comes to *"stayin' warm"*! Read on if you feel the cold but would rather not.

## Layering is good

1. **Get some thermals for a next-to-skin layer.**  
These will be your best friend. A thermal baselayer sits underneath all your other clothes, resting above just your underwear. It not only provides warmth, but also moves sweat away from your skin so you don't end up cold, wet, and clammy. Because it's skin-tight, it also does a bang-up job of stopping any errant drafts that make it up the back of your jacket or down your sleeves. Baselayers of this type are typically wool, polyester, polypropylene, or a blend thereof.

**I recommend getting a pair of thermal leggings, too**. Pants tend not to be very warm, so pop these bad boys under them. As an added bonus, you can tuck your thermal top into your thermal pants for extra snuggly warmth.  
Thermals will be the first things you put on and the last things you take off.
2. **Grab a warm mid-layer**. A mid layer fits over your thermals but under a bigger jacket. Think woollen sweaters, fleece jackets, thick pullovers, etc. **Wool or fleece is ideal**, as cotton absorbs water and dries slowly. If it has a collar, it'll help keep your neck warm.

You'll likely have this on all day, as it offers warmth but isn't oppressively hot. Choose something you'll be comfortable in but can fit under your outer jacket (see next point).
3. **A big fuck-off outer layer**. For all you coldies, down is king. An enormous, thick duck- or goose-down jacket is good shit. It's like a sauna inside, they're made for people like you.

A hood is nice to have as it keep any wind off the back of your neck.
**If you don't own a down jacket**, a **thick wool**, **heavy fleece** or **synthetic insulation** parka is the next best option. Long sleeves, a high collar, the longer length the better.

Keep in mind that both your **mid- and outer-layers** will be abused a bit. Sitting against trees, grass, logs, and rocks will wear at the fabric. Synthetic fibres are vulnerable to flame... don't touch the fire or your jacket will melt. 

## Â°Â·.Â¸.->   ðŸŽ€  Accessorise!  ðŸŽ€   >-.Â¸.Â·Â°
- **Scarf**  
Your neck will get cold if it's exposed. Bring a warm scarf or neck gaiter to keep it covered. High collars can do this during the day, but bring a scarf for night time. 
- **Beanie**  
Your noggin gives off a lot of heat, bring a beanie. You can combo it with a hood for those crispy mornings. 
- **Earmuffs?**  
If you've got them, I won't stop you.
- **Gloves**  
Pockets on a down jacket are very warm, but you can't do much with your hands in them. Some fleece, wool, or polypropylene gloves can keep you warm-ish while still retaining dexterity. 
- **Socks**  
**Please bring warm socks**. Thick wool, wool-blend or fleece socks are ideal. You can pop them over thermal leggings

## Things to Consider
- Reusable hand warmers will give you an hour of *extra toasty hands* per use.
